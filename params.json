{"name":"Csc","tagline":"CSC: A cross server chat module for Garry's Mod 13","body":"## Introduction\r\nThis is an addon I created for garry's mod due to the massive demand for an addon that makes it possible to communicate across many servers.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nThis addon **REQUIRES** [gmsv_glsock2](http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1234005). Unfortunately, this module is currently only available for windows, if someone could compile it for linux I would love them forever <3.\r\n\r\n1. Download and place [gmsv_glsock2_win32.dll](https://mattmodules.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gm_glsock/Release/gmsv_glsock2_win32.dll) into garrysmod/lua/bin in the servers you wish to run this addon on.\r\n\r\n2. Download the CSC zip file , extract addons/csc and place the csc folder the addons folders on the servers you wish to run this addon on.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\nIn CSC there are two configuration files, they are both located in csc/lua/csc/ in your addons folder.\r\n\r\n### Configuring sv_csc_config.lua\r\n**csc.config.port** - This is the port that the chat server runs on, this can be unique on each server as long as you use the port you defined when it comes to adding the servers. _You cannot use the same port and IP as another CSC server_\r\n\r\n**csc.config.password** - This _must_ be the same on all servers, this password is required so people cannot remotely spam your chat. I also recommend you use a strong password.\r\n\r\n**csc.config.id** - This _must_ be unique on each server, this is for the script to identify each server and also shows up in the chat.\r\n\r\n**csc.config.alltext** - When set to true, all chat typed on the server will be broadcast across all servers\r\n\r\n**csc.config.chatcmd** - When the above is set to false, CSC uses a chat command to use global chat, configure what chat command you want yo use here.\r\n\r\n**csc.config.faillimit** - The amount of times a server can use a bad password before getting IP banned.\r\n\r\n**csc.config.cooldown** - When using a chat command, you have the option to have a cooldown. This is the amount of seconds that cooldown lasts for (set to 0 to disable).\r\n\r\n### Adding servers\r\nAdding servers in CSC is simple, all it requires is for that server to be running the CSC addon.\r\n\r\nAdd the following code to the bottom of sv_csc_config.lua\r\n`csc.addServer(\"IP\", PORT)`\r\n\r\nReplace IP with the IP or hostname of the server you wish to add, be sure to keep the quotation marks.\r\nReplace PORT with the port you defined in csc.config.port on the server you wish to add.\r\n\r\nContinue this process for each server you wish to add, there are no limits for the amounts of servers in CSC.\r\n\r\n### Configuring cl_csc_config.lua\r\ncl_csc_config.lua contains settings for the aesthetics of CSC.\r\n\r\nYou can get the RGB Color codes required from [this link](http://www.colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/)\r\n\r\n***csc.config.idcolor*** - Sets the color of the ID chat tag.\r\n\r\n***csc.config.namecolor*** - Sets the color of the name chat tag.\r\n\r\n## Developing with CSC\r\nI decided to make a PHP class so that people can integrate CSC with their community website easily.\r\n\r\nThe class file can be found [here](https://github.com/MattWalton12/CSC/blob/master/misc/csc.class.php).\r\n\r\n### Basic example\r\n`require_once(\"csc.class.php\");` You first need to include the class file so we can use its functionality in our script.\r\n\r\n`$chat = new CSC(\"127.0.0.1\", 13375, \"abc123\", \"WEB\");` Create a new CSC object.\r\n\r\n**Parameters:**\r\n\r\n1. Host/IP of the remote server you wish to communicate with.\r\n2. The CSC port of the remote server.\r\n3. The password of the remote server.\r\n4. The ID that will show up in the chat , use \"\" to not use an ID.\r\n\r\n`$chat->send(\"Matt\", \"Hello world!\");` - Sends the message Hello world! with the player name of Matt into the chat on the remote server, you can also specify \"\" as the first parameter to get rid of the name.\r\n\r\n### Additional functions\r\nI added some additional functions to make it easy to communicate with multiple servers without creating multiple php objects.\r\n\r\n`$chat->setHost($HOST)` - Update the host/IP of the remote server.\r\n\r\n`$chat->setPort($PORT)` - Update the port of the remote server.\r\n\r\n`$chat->setPassword($PASSWORD)` - Update the password of the remote server.\r\n\r\n`$chat->setID($ID)` - Update the ID","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
