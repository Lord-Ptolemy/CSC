{"name":"Csc","tagline":"CSC: A cross server chat module for Garry's Mod 13","body":"## Introduction\r\nThis is an addon I created for garry's mod due to the massive demand for an addon that makes it possible to communicate across many servers.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nThis addon **REQUIRES** gmsv_glsock2 (http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1234005). Unfortunately, this module is currently only available for windows, if someone could compile it for linux I would love them forever <3.\r\n\r\n1. Place gmsv_glsock2_win32.dll into garrysmod/lua/bin in the servers you wish to run this addon on.\r\n2. Place the csc folder the addons folders on the servers you wish to run this addon on.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\nIn CSC there are two configuration files, they are both located in csc/lua/csc/ in your addons folder.\r\n\r\n### Configuring sv_csc_config.lua\r\n\r\n**csc.config.port** - This is the port that the chat server runs on, this can be unique on each server as long as you use the port you defined when it comes to adding the servers. _You cannot use the same port and IP as another CSC server_\r\n\r\n**csc.config.password** - This _must_ be the same on all servers, this password is required so people cannot remotely spam your chat. I also recommend you use a strong password.\r\n\r\n**csc.config.id** - This _must_ be unique on each server, this is for the script to identify each server and also shows up in the chat.\r\n\r\n**csc.config.alltext** - When set to true, all chat typed on the server will be broadcast across all servers\r\n\r\n**csc.config.chatcmd** - When the above is set to false, CSC uses a chat command to use global chat, configure what chat command you want yo use here.\r\n\r\n**csc.config.faillimit** - The amount of times a server can use a bad password before getting IP banned.\r\n\r\n**csc.config.cooldown** - When using a chat command, you have the option to have a cooldown. This is the amount of seconds that cooldown lasts for (set to 0 to disable).\r\n\r\n### Adding servers\r\nAdding servers in CSC is simple, all it requires is for that server to be running the CSC addon.\r\n\r\n`csc.addServer(\"IP\", PORT)`\r\n\r\nReplace IP with the IP or hostname of the server you wish to add, be sure to keep the quotation marks.\r\nReplace PORT with the port you defined in csc.config.port on the server you wish to add.\r\n\r\nContinue this process for each server you wish to add, there are no limits for the amounts of servers in CSC.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
